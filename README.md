## Understanding Check - AJAX and Front End Routing!

Hello! This is a small exercise that should take you in between 15 and 40 minutes.

The purpose is to check your understanding of:
  - Sending Ajax requests to our server to request information
  - Once we get that information, changing the DOM in some way
  - Using Event Listeners to respond to user behavior
  - Manipulating the url bar (client side routing!) to give our user a better experience

We have a site that we want to use to display cute dogs, cats, and dragons! But not all at the same time! We want to have a dogs page, a cats page, and a dragons page but not have to reload the page each time we switch. We should be able to navigate between the dogs, cats, and dragons pages via the url bar (which will reload the page) or the buttons, which will change the view without reloading the page, and update the url bar.

To start, run:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

You are only expected to write code in client/index.js. However, you are welcome to add styles and other features if you want!  All your express routes are written for you. There is no database, the data is all mocked out.
